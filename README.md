# This is Impostor Engineer

Coding is a hobby of mine. I know basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some Python.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Nothing really...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: JavaScript / Python
- ðŸ¤” Wondering what to do next... Maybe React?
- ðŸ¤” Maybe an RFID tag reader that logs to a mongodb.
